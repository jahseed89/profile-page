					<h1>ABOUT ME...</h1>
					<br>
					<p>Am a Software developer (beginner), started my first code early January 2020. And working hard to become an Important inspiratory to other upcoming programmers.<br>
					Me starting this carrier has not been an easy thing(#), but at the end of each challenge, it makes me come up with a cool result.<br>
					Programming is not easy they say! But one thing I have learned so far is that, once someone has made up his/her mind to love this carrier its makes him/she feel companionate of doing this. And now I can say; I have become a lover of programming.<br>
					Not only that I also love listening to music, playing games like video soccer, and also love football (but there is no time  to waist in playing football for now since I love to code) also I love Entertainment in addition.<br>
					Main reason for my interest in software developing is that, being a developer, itâ€™s just like a handy work which someone has learned for future establishment. And for software development, it has become a worldwide developing asset.  So I have made up my mind to learn/work hard to aim high in these association development.<br>
					In addition, is also something that one loves to do always once he/she have the knowledge of it. These are some of my reasons in the interest of becoming an inspired web developer.<br>
					Thank You.
